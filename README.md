# Skateboard-Gallery-App

Project that uses React, Firebase and CSS modules.

This project includes a sign-up and Login page, as well as users to publicly add image files (JPG, PNG) that are stored in a Firebase Database.

I created this project so skateboarders can share their skate photos and skateboard related art.

Features that will be added;
  - a like button, with a display of the total of likes recieved for each image
  - Allow users to be able to comment on images
  - A page for users to store photos that they especially like in their own private gallery page
